  <p>
    CashWise is a financial education and tools platform designed to help people
    understand, manage, and improve their personal finances. We believe that
    financial stability should not be limited to experts or high-income earners,
    but should be accessible to anyone willing to learn and take control of
    their money.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many individuals struggle with budgeting, saving, banking decisions, and
    long-term financial planning due to a lack of clear and practical information.
